<p>
    <strong>notify.run</strong> lets you send notifications to your own phone or desktop with minimal fuss. This is primarily useful
    for tracking the progress of long-running compute jobs.
</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<div class="ui segment" id="quickstart" style="min-height: 120px;">
</div>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>Each user of notify.run is assigned a
    <strong>channel</strong>, identified by a random string. Devices which support the
    <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=push-api">Web Push API</a>, including Chrome and Firefox for desktop and Android, can subscribe to notifications on a channel and
    show a pop-up notification. Other devices, such as iOS Safari, do not yet support the API needed for background notifications,
    but they can still be used to see a list of recent notifications.
</p>

<p>
    Each channel has its own HTTP(S) endpoint. When you
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">POST</a> a message to that endpoint, notify.run relays it to every subscription on that channel.
</p>
<p>
    notify.run uses standard APIs for both sending and subscribing to notifications, which means that it can be used without
    installling any software. If you prefer, you can use the command-line tool and Python package to simplify integration
    with your workflow.</p>

<h2>Integrations</h2>

<h3>Command-line interface</h3>

<p>
    The command-line interface and Python API are part of the
    <samp>notify-run</samp> Python package. You can install both using the
    <samp>pip</samp> package manager
</p>

<pre>pip install notify-run</pre>

<p>
    Once it has been installed, you can register a new channel like so:
</p>

<pre>notify-run register</pre>

<p>
    Alternatively, you can configure it to use a channel that already exists:
</p>

<pre>notify-run configure https://notify.run/<strong>[channel name]</strong></pre>

<p>
    The configuration is stored in the
    <samp>~/.config/notify-run</samp> file in your home directory. It will be picked up by subsequent runs of
    <samp>notify-run</samp> as well as the
    <samp>notify_run</samp>
    Python module.
</p>

<h3>Jupyter</h3>

<p>When used inside a Jupyter notebook, the subscribe link is clickable and a QR code is displayed.
</p>

<h3>Keras</h3>

<p>Notify includes a callback for
    <a href="https://keras.io">Keras</a> which sends a progress notification at the end of each epoch. After configuring an endpoint above, import
    <samp>NotifyCallback</samp> from
    <samp>notify_run.keras</samp> and pass it in the callback parameter to a Keras
    <samp>fit</samp> method.</p>

<pre>from notify_run.keras import NotifyCallback
# model is a Keras model that you have created elsewhere.
model.fit(x, y, callbacks=[NotifyCallback()])</pre>

    run your own instance of the server on your own network.
